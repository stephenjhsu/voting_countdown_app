You know the story - you run the code, head out for lunch, and come back hoping your code finished running without breaking. Nodifly ends this process of guessing and checking when the code finishes.

Nodifly is a no-frills, software as a service that can be used to notify users via email or text when the code has been completed, errored out, or met any user-defined conditions. Furthermore, Nodifly provides interactive dashboards to analyze slowdowns, breakdowns, and trends within the coding process.
